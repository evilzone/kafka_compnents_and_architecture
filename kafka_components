kafka components:
----------------

- Producer: publish message/ events
- Consumer: receive message/ events
- Broker: kafka server
    - the kafka broker is nothing but just a server. In simple words, a broker is just an intermediate
       entity that helps in message exchanges between a producer and a consumer.
- Cluster: multiple brokers inside a kafka cluster
- Topic: create multiple topic to store different types of messages
    - segregate different event types to different topics
    - it specifies the category of the message or the classification of the message.
       listeners can then just respond to the messages that belong to the topics they are listening on
- Partitions
- Offset
- Consumer groups
    - payment_consumer_group
    - multiple consumers in the group
    - any partition can be read by any consumer that will be decided by coordinator
    - extra consumers will sit idle
    - if consumer if rejected, then idle consumer will consumer events
        this is called re-balancing
- Zookeeper
    -zookeeper is a pre-requisite for kafka. kafka is a distributed system, and
        zookeeper for coordination and to track the status of kafka cluster nodes.
        it also keeps track of kafka topics, partitions, offsets, etc.

- kafka cluster can have one or more servers (brokers)
- kafka server can have one or more topics
- each topic can have multiple partitions
- producer can publish event and it can sit in any of the partitions in the topic
    based on the round-robin applications
- In kafka, a sequence number is assigned to each message in each partition of a kafka topic
    - this sequence number is called offset
